# Bot Classification Using Graph Based Roles and Features
Augmenting bot detection and classification by using graph based roles.

## How to Run
All deps can be installed using `pipenv` (`pip install pipenv`). Once these are installed jupyter notebook can be launched (`jupyter notebook`). The `Classification Evaluation.ipynb` file contains all classification training and does not rely on any of the other notebooks being run on your machine prior. Running through all cells in this notebook will spit out accuracy results in tables. These results may not match the results from the report but they will after running through a couple of times.
